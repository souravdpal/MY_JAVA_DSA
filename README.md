## 📚 Roadmap
I will cover the following topics step-by-step:

- ✅ Java Basics
- ✅ Conditional Statements & Loops
- ✅ Functions & Methods
- ✅ Arrays
- ✅ Strings
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- ✅ Linked Lists
- ✅ Stacks & Queues
- ✅ Trees
- ✅ Recursion
- ✅ Sorting Algorithms
- ✅ Backtracking
- ✅ Graphs
- ✅ Competitive Problems (Coming Soon 🚧)
